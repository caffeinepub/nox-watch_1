  "summary": "Implements a React+TS marketing site with TanStack Router pages (Home/Catalog/About/Contact), a site-wide layout with responsive navigation and footer, centralized content/config in `noxContent.ts`, product catalog grid with client-side search/sort, and a contact form with client-side validation and success state. Some requested static generated images cannot be confirmed from the provided diff summary, and there are several additions not explicitly requested (backend actor stub, Internet Identity/react-query hooks, social links/business hours).",

      "id": "REQ-7",
      "requirement": "Add required generated static images under `frontend/public/assets/generated` and render them in the Home and Catalog pages as default placeholders.",
      "reason": "The frontend references paths like `/assets/generated/...png` in `frontend/src/content/noxContent.ts`, but the diff summary does not show the actual image files being added under `frontend/public/assets/generated` (and omitted files are not listed). Therefore the presence of the required generated images cannot be verified from the provided evidence.",

      "description": "Added a backend Motoko actor stub (`actor {}`) even though backend work was to be added only if strictly necessary for the requested UI.",
      "reason": "UI is implemented as a static marketing site; no backend interaction is shown/required for the requested pages/forms (form submission is simulated client-side).",
